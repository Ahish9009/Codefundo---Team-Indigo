# Codefundo---Team-Indigo
## Team Indigo's idea for Code.Fun.Do

### Introduction

Our idea is divided into two parts:
* A Drone System
* A Hub System

#### Target Disasters 
  * Earthquakes, Floods, Tsunamis, Landslides, etc.

### Drone System

We plan to build a network of drones in order to help locate and distribute resources among the disaster-stricken people. It will also be used as a real time source of data from the affected region.

* Drone Features
  * GPS Enabled
  * 3-Axis Camera
  * Connectivity to Azure Cloud
  * Connectivity to Base
  * Low to Medium sized Payload

#### Working

  Drones will be deployed across the disaster-stricken region in an optimal manner. Each drone will be connected to the base,    ie. the data center(where all the data collected by the drone will be sent for processing). Each drone will collect data in real time by uploading it to the base.
