# Codefundo---Team-Indigo
## Team Indigo's idea for Code.Fun.Do

### Introduction

Our idea is divided into two parts:
* A Drone System
* A Hub System

### Drone System

We plan to build a network of drones in order to help locate and distribute resources among the disaster-stricken people. It will also be used as a real time source of data from the affected region.
* Target Disasters
** Earthquakes
